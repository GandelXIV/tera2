TODO:

- [x] Wire up new error struct in lexer2
- [x] Add insta tests for lexing errors
- [ ] Start writing parser, copying most of parser.rs probably
- [ ] Adds lots of tests, some with insta some without -> including errors
- [ ] Delete logos lexer/tests/parser
- [ ] Polish lexer + parser until it's perfect
- [ ] Investigate minijinja bytecode approach vs AST (more performant probably but error reporting?)
